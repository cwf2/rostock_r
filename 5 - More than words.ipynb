    "# Features beyond words\n",
    "\n",
    "To this point, we’ve looked at how to get capture the structure of text as tabular data in R. Words have been the atomic units of interest, or **features**, and the process of creating a table in which each feature is quantified for each text sample is often called **feature extraction**.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this section we’ll look at some alternative feature sets beyond words—although most of these are derived from words in some way. Sometimes we collapse words together, for example by **stemming** or **part of speech** tagging, resulting in a smaller feature set. Sometimes, by contrast, we look at word combinations, **n-grams**, and the feature set becomes even bigger. In either case, we will likely go through a process of **feature selection** later, where we mix and match the features most useful to our specific task.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Responsions between author and audience\n",
    "\n",
    "One of my favourite aspects of Homer’s poems is the evidence that their oral-formulaic origins has left in the text of an intimate feedback loop between the singer and the audience: the scenes that have been elaborated and adorned with formulas to luxuriate in the listeners’ attention; the concise way information can be condensed when the plot needs to more forward.\n",
    "\n",
    "But the feedback process is not limited to oral composition. Vergil showed the enomous originality that was possible in \"fan fiction\" when he turned the raw material of Homer to his own epic purposes. As he was still composing the *Aeneid*, he was already receiving \"comments\" from his audience, for example Propertius 2.34.66, *nescio quid maius nascitur Iliade*, \"Something greater than the Iliad is coming to birth.\" In particular, he seems to quote Vergil’s own preface to the second half of the Aeneid, which he calls a *maius opus*, \"a greater work\" (Aen. 7.45).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Fans and fan fiction\n",
    "\n",
    "In 2014, author Anna Todd composed the novel *After* largely on her phone, using the online self-publishing platform Wattpad. The novel was conceived as a fan fiction, not of a book or film, but of the real-life boy-band One Direction. The story became wildly popular, with readership topping 1,000,000,000 views even as she was writing. According to a contemporary interview with the *New York Times*, she would generate new content daily in response to reader’s comments, shaping the storyline in response to their own fantasies as well as her own. Despite the fact that the novel is [still available for free on Wattpad](https://www.wattpad.com/story/5095707-after), Todd went on to sign a \"six-figure\" book deal, including film rights. \n",
    "\n",
    "Not all authors experience this feedback loop so positively, however. George R. R. Martin, author of *A Game of Thrones* and its sequels, reported in an interview that he had been forced to stop reading the theories of his fans online. As he continued to develop the labyrinthine subplots and Tolstoy-sized cast of characters, he had found himself deliberately trying to outsmart the readers. When they correctly guessed the path of the plot, he would change it to foil them. But, he grimly noted, \"That way lies madness and disaster.\" As he fell victim to depression and writer’s block, some fans turned against him. In forums like [Finish the Book, George](https://grrrm.livejournal.com/), some goaded and provoked him. Eventually, the course of the novels was overcome by the television series.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Case study: Annacharlier’s *Don’t Go*\n",
    "\n",
    "<div style=\"float:right; width:250px; margin:1.5em\">\n",
    "    <figure>\n",
    "        <img src=\"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/1/1c/She-Ra_comparison.png\" alt=\"image\">\n",
    "        <caption>She-Ra in 1985 and 2018. <br/>Source: wikipedia.org</caption>\n",
    "    </figure>\n",
    "</div>\n",
    "\n",
    "For the rest of this session, I want to look at an interesting convolution of fan-author feedback, drawn from the fan fiction web site [Archive of Our Own](https://archiveofourown.org/) (AO3). Annacharlier’s 5000-word *Don’t Go* is the most-read submission within the fandom dedicated to \"She-Ra and the Princesses of Power,\" a Netflix children’s cartoon. \"She-Ra\" is itself intertextual, being a 2018 reboot of an earlier children’s show from the 1980s, in part deliberately designed to subvert the original program’s messaging about gender norms, sexuality, and body image.\n",
    "\n",
    "Like many fan fictions, *Don’t Go* represents beloved characters, in this case the protagonist Adora and her principal antagonist Catra, in the \"downtime\" between episodes, allowing the audience to indulge in a [sense of immersion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parasocial_interaction) in the character’s everyday lives. Also like many fan fictions (dating back at least to the revolutionary Kirk/Spock amateur fictions of the mid-twentieth century), this one develops a same-sex romantic relationship (or **ship**) between principal characters. (Unlike the Kirk/Spock relationship, the \"Catradora\" ship was established as canonical in the series finale, released a mere 5 days before this story was posted.)\n",
    " \n",
    "What makes the story interesting to me, however, is that not long after it appeared on the site, its pseudonymous author was revealed to be ND Stevenson, the show’s creater herself, granting quasi-canonical status to the events described along with enormous encouragement to other fan-fiction authors. In the examples below, we’ll practice downloading the story from AO3 and performing several different feature extraction techniques."
